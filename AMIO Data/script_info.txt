data_plots.py
contains code to parse data (script originally written for ROB311)
Input .txt files to easily create plots  

How to parse data 
- Arduino serial monitor needs to be off 
- Change into a txt file so that everything is a string 
- remove any remaining data 
- first line should be the putty output giving timestamp
